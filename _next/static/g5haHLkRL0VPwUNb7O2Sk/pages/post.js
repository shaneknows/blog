What makes things even sweeter is how easily you can deploy to Github Pages to show off all of your work. I was able to even port my Unity game to a React app and deploy it to my site [here](https://shaneknows.github.io/Naifu)!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alright you have my attention... how?\\r\\n\\r\\nWell first off download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install npm by opening up your command prompt (or use the terminal in Visual Studio Code) and running:\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm install @npm -g\\r\\n```\\r\\nNow that you have npm installed. You will want to install the create-react-app npm package by running:\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm install create-react-app -g\\r\\n```\\r\\nNavigate to the folder you wish to create your app and run:\\r\\n```bash\\r\\ncreate-react-app <name of project>\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis should take a little bit of time but by the time it finishes you will have a working react app you can toy around with. Make sure you switch to the working directory you just created and you can run the app\\r\\n```bash\\r\\ncd <your project name>\\r\\nnpm start\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cool now how can I show this off?\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming you have a [Github account](https://github.com/) it\'s quite easy. First create a repository for your current React application on Github. Now back in your project lets install github pages so we can generate and deploy the app as a static site for github pages.\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm install --save-dev gh-pages\\r\\n```\\r\\nNow in your project\'s project.json we need to add a deploy option under the `scripts` section:\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n\\"deploy\\":\\"npm run build&&gh-pages -d build\\"\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis will build our project and publish it to a `gh-pages` branch under your project.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we are almost ready to deploy. First you will want to set your `homepage` in your project.json file. It should be updated and named `https://<username>.github.io/<projectname>`\\r\\n\\r\\nNow run \\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm run deploy\\r\\n``` \\r\\nto build and publish to the `gh-pages` branch of our repository. If there isn\'t a branch, it will be created. Now let\'s setup our project to enable GitHub Pages. Under the repository settings on Github, find the GitHub Pages section and set the `Source` to use the `gh-pages` branch via the dropdown list.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow again run\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm run deploy\\r\\n```\\r\\nand you should be able to navigate to your homepage URL and find your working app!\\r\\n\\r\\n### Alright so now what about Unity?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlright so if you don\'t have a working Unity game feel free to fork mine [here](https://github.com/shaneknows/NaifuGame). Install the latest version of [Unity3d](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) and open the project. Select `File`->`Build and Run`. We want to build the project for WebGL so select that option and provide a Folder name. Once the process has complete you should see your game running in a web browser. If everything appears to be working fine, copy the files from the created folder and paste them in the `public` folder of your React application. This should override the default `index.html` file. Open up the `index.html` file and add `%PUBLIC_PATH%/` in front of the src tags so our file references will work locally and while deployed. Your file should look something like:\\r\\n```html\\r\\n<!DOCTYPE html>\\r\\n<html lang=\\"en-us\\">\\r\\n  <head>\\r\\n    <meta charset=\\"utf-8\\">\\r\\n    <meta http-equiv=\\"Content-Type\\" content=\\"text/html; charset=utf-8\\">\\r\\n    <title>Unity WebGL Player | {game name}</title>\\r\\n    <link rel=\\"shortcut icon\\" href=\\"%PUBLIC_URL%/TemplateData/favicon.ico\\">\\r\\n    <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"%PUBLIC_URL%/TemplateData/style.css\\">\\r\\n    <script src=\\"%PUBLIC_URL%/TemplateData/UnityProgress.js\\"><\/script>  \\r\\n    <script src=\\"%PUBLIC_URL%/Build/UnityLoader.js\\"><\/script>\\r\\n    <script>\\r\\n      var gameInstance = UnityLoader.instantiate(\\"gameContainer\\", \\"%PUBLIC_URL%/Build/<game name>.json\\", {onProgress: UnityProgress});\\r\\n    <\/script>\\r\\n  </head>\\r\\n  <body>\\r\\n    <div class=\\"webgl-content\\">\\r\\n      <div id=\\"gameContainer\\" style=\\"width: 665px; height: 400px\\"></div>\\r\\n      <div class=\\"footer\\">\\r\\n        <div class=\\"webgl-logo\\"></div>\\r\\n        <div class=\\"fullscreen\\" onclick=\\"gameInstance.SetFullscreen(1)\\"></div>\\r\\n        <div class=\\"title\\">{game name}</div>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  </body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will also want to clear out the JSX (The HTML-like syntax found in the `render` function) rendered in the `App.js` file. Just return an empty div instead or you will get errors when running. You could also just completely comment out the `index.js` file if you don\'t intend on adding any react code. Now test your app by running `npm start`.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf everything seems to be working, run `npm run deploy` again and you should see your game running on your Github Pages site!\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy coding.","bodyHtml":"<p>Recently I have been tinkering with React and really digging how easy it is to get up and running using the <a href=\\"https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\\">Create React App</a>.

I was in the market for a new desk, but was also planning on moving soon so I didn\'t want to purchase a desk only to have it not fit comfortably in my next house. After buying the largest board that would fit the desk, sanding, staining, and mounting I had a beautiful desk and peace of mind knowing I could easily saw down later if it ended up taking up too much space in my next office. Fortunately I haven\'t had to make any adjustments yet, but I feel confident knowing that the choice to make a modification to the desk won\'t mean buying an entirely new one (maybe just a small can of stain).\\r\\n\\r\\n![Desk](https://github.com/shaneknows/blog/raw/dev/src/images/desk.jpg \\"Desk\\")\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was at it, I also build a matching shelf to hand in my office.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Shelf](https://github.com/shaneknows/blog/raw/dev/src/images/shelf.jpg \\"Shelf\\")\\r\\n\\r\\nCons\\r\\n- Ended up not mattering, but the threads when assembling the desk are fairly easy to strip so be careful assembling the horizontal bar.\\r\\n![Stripped Thread](https://github.com/shaneknows/blog/raw/dev/src/images/stripped.jpg \\"Stripped Thread\\")\\r\\n- Finding a large enough board can be a pain (but that\'s also part of the fun)\\r\\n- Doesn\'t look flashy, but that\'s up to the creator to customize away\\r\\n\\r\\nPros\\r\\n- Easily adjustable height. There were some complaints I heard from people about the manual hand crank taking too long and to that I just shake my head.

but hadn\'t gotten around to it. With the unfortunate state of the world due to the COVID-19 outbreak, now seems like a better time than any for some self care tips.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Morning Exercise**\\r\\n\\r\\nEver get tired in the middle of the day? Maybe closer to the end of the day? I know the last thing you want to here is try exercising in the morning, but a super quick, light workout can do wonders for your energy throughout the day. My recommendation is just 10 minutes of yoga every morning. This can range from just some simple stretches to a fully generated yoga workout. My personal recommendation is the [Down Dog Yoga App](https://www.downdogapp.com/). This application includes randomized workouts of whatever length you desire. You could use this application for your morning wake up, as well as your evening exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Easy Diets**\\r\\n\\r\\nI hate dieting. I\'ve always been behind the idea of \\"if I exercise enough, I can eat whatever I want.\\" Sadly a recent doctor\'s visit disproved this idea. I had mildly high blood pressure, which with the help of my wife we quickly reduced to a healthy level. Making healthy meals every single night, and worrying about it for lunch became a pain. I gave the product [Huel](https://huel.com/) a try and was pleasantly surprised. I had tried the very similar product [Soylent](https://soylent.com/), but felt slightly ill and still hungry. Later I learned that this effect may have been due to my auto immune disease. Both of these products taste great to me so if one doesn\'t work for you, I recommend trying the other. These are shakes that make for nutritionally complete meals. With Huel being pretty low in sodium, after drinking one shake for breakfast and another for lunch I am comfortable with eating most foods at dinner. This has come even more in hand now as we stock up for food during this shut-in due to COVID-19. Can\'t speak for Soylent, but my brief interaction with Huel\'s customer service has been stellar. There is also a huge community for baking and mixing Huel in various ways, but the company provides flavor enhancers themselves as well (I have yet to try these). I have been happy enough with the plain Huel powder flavor and mixing the chocolate Huel powder with some peanut butter protein powder.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Hydration**\\r\\n\\r\\nSounds dumb, but seriously... just buy a big insulated jug to put water in you keep it with and filled for most of the day. I find myself drinking subconciously now and I feel so much more awake and full. Feeling sluggish or having random cravings? Drink more water.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Dungeons and Dragons**\\r\\n\\r\\nSay what you want about D&D being nerdy and all, but it is one of those games that is what you make it. Playing games like Apples to Apples is dreadful to me with family, but with a close group of friends all games become so much better. I\'ve been playing D&D for maybe 3 years now and after a few months of not being so sure how I felt, I now love this game. It\'s just a game where you can do whatever you want and goof around with your friends. Finding someone confident enough that understands the group\'s humour and style is very critical, but once you establish this group of friends you all will make memories for life. Check out [Critical Role](https://www.twitch.tv/criticalrole) if you want to see some of the best voice actors play, but don\'t let that discourage you. Like I said, the game is what you make it and there are several tools to make the game less daunting. If you like to get together wither your friends in person, check out [DND Beyond](https://dndbeyond.com) to get started. You can purchase the books and share with your friends if you are running your campaign through the website. To run your session entirely online you can use [Roll20](https://roll20.net). My group and I use this every week, but I have not personally run a session this way as the Dungeon Master before. There are several different One Shots you can try in the official source material or just by searching online (One Shots are single sessions where you can play the entire story in one 1-4 hour sitting).\\r\\n\\r\\n**2 Player Board Games**\\r\\n\\r\\nGot a significant other that you love to binge TV shows with all of the time? Find yourselves some nights just drifting away looking at your cell phones? There are so many great two player board games out there to play. My wife and I just started a trend where we pick up a new board game each month to try out and slowly build our catalogue. So far we have really enjoyed [Patchwork](https://www.amazon.com/Mayfair-Games-MFG3505-Patchwork/dp/B00RCCAPPE/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=pathwork&qid=1584491187&sr=8-1) and [7 Wonders - Duel](https://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-SEV07-7-Wonders-Duel/dp/B014DMSTXK/ref=pd_bxgy_img_3/139-8395503-1468251?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B014DMSTXK&pd_rd_r=0a60e0ce-6ab1-4b7f-bf78-fa1793a335b6&pd_rd_w=ai4du&pd_rd_wg=eLM9j&pf_rd_p=1b7ae7c4-8437-4495-a779-460fb30ae641&pf_rd_r=5J1VJ9NSZ951MDH4975Q&psc=1&refRID=5J1VJ9NSZ951MDH4975Q). Both of these games are stricty for 2 players. Duel is fairly complex, so I recommend Patchwork over that for the less experience board game players. Many hobby shops have sections dedicated entirely to two player games. Oddly enough what inspired me to do this was that my wife and I had a blast playing table top RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons 1 on 1, but I wanted something with less role playing involved for a more casual setup.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Got any tips?**\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are just some recent things that have brought me joy that I wanted to share. Please let me know some of your tips or what you think of these if you try them. [Chat with me on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/shanekn0ws). Until next time.","bodyHtml":"<p>I\'ve been meaning to write this post for a while, but hadn\'t gotten around to it.

So far we have really enjoyed <a href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Mayfair-Games-MFG3505-Patchwork/dp/B00RCCAPPE/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=pathwork&amp;qid=1584491187&amp;sr=8-1\\">Patchwork</a> and <a href=\\"https://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-SEV07-7-Wonders-Duel/dp/B014DMSTXK/ref=pd_bxgy_img_3/139-8395503-1468251?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B014DMSTXK&amp;pd_rd_r=0a60e0ce-6ab1-4b7f-bf78-fa1793a335b6&amp;pd_rd_w=ai4du&amp;pd_rd_wg=eLM9j&amp;pf_rd_p=1b7ae7c4-8437-4495-a779-460fb30ae641&amp;pf_rd_r=5J1VJ9NSZ951MDH4975Q&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=5J1VJ9NSZ951MDH4975Q\\">7 Wonders - Duel</a>. Both of these games are stricty for 2 players. Duel is fairly complex, so I recommend Patchwork over that for the less experience board game players. Many hobby shops have sections dedicated entirely to two player games. Oddly enough what inspired me to do this was that my wife and I had a blast playing table top RPGs such as Dungeons and Dragons 1 on 1, but I wanted something with less role playing involved for a more casual setup.</p>\\n<p><strong>Got any tips?</strong></p>\\n<p>These are just some recent things that have brought me joy that I wanted to share.
