<p>The best selling feature of this desk IMO isn't the adjustable height, but the adjustable width. I was in the market for a new desk, but was also planning on moving soon so I didn't want to purchase a desk only to have it not fit comfortably in my next house. After buying the largest board that would fit the desk, sanding, staining, and mounting I had a beautiful desk and peace of mind knowing I could easily saw down later if it ended up taking up too much space in my next office. Fortunately I haven't had to make any adjustments yet, but I feel confident knowing that the choice to make a modification to the desk won't mean buying an entirely new one (maybe just a small can of stain).</p>

<p>While I was at it, I also build a matching shelf to hand in my office.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/shaneknows/blog/raw/dev/src/images/shelf.jpg" alt="Shelf" title="Shelf"></p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Ended up not mattering, but the threads when assembling the desk are fairly easy to strip so be careful assembling the horizontal bar.

<li>Finding a large enough board can be a pain (but that's also part of the fun)</li>
<li>Doesn't look flashy, but that's up to the creator to customize away</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily adjustable height. There were some complaints I heard from people about the manual hand crank taking too long and to that I just shake my head. If you can't turn a crank 10-20 times to stand up you probably also think riding a bike down your driveway is a chore.</li>
<li>Durable. I also read complaints about durability. I've moved twice since building this and it's still solid.</li>
<li>Price. Under 200 for the frame and you should be able to find a board for around $50 or less</li>
<li>Customizable. Unlike cheap Ikea furniture, if you use real wood you don't have to worry about screwing in PC mounts, shelving, or whatever weird customizations you may want to make.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2P8z4LU">Also if you need some cable management, VIVO makes this sleeve that worked perfectly for me.</a></p>
<p>tldr; I recommend this desk for anyone really as long as you have the need for a desk at least 40 inches wide.</p>
