I was in the market for a new desk, but was also planning on moving soon so I didn't want to purchase a desk only to have it not fit comfortably in my next house. After buying the largest board that would fit the desk, sanding, staining, and mounting I had a beautiful desk and peace of mind knowing I could easily saw down later if it ended up taking up too much space in my next office. Fortunately I haven't had to make any adjustments yet, but I feel confident knowing that the choice to make a modification to the desk won't mean buying an entirely new one (maybe just a small can of stain).\r\n\r\n![Desk](https://github.com/shaneknows/blog/raw/dev/src/images/desk.jpg \"Desk\")\r\n\r\nWhile I was at it, I also build a matching shelf to hand in my office.\r\n\r\n![Shelf](https://github.com/shaneknows/blog/raw/dev/src/images/shelf.jpg \"Shelf\")\r\n\r\nCons\r\n- Ended up not mattering, but the threads when assembling the desk are fairly easy to strip so be careful assembling the horizontal bar.\r\n![Stripped Thread](https://github.com/shaneknows/blog/raw/dev/src/images/stripped.jpg \"Stripped Thread\")\r\n- Finding a large enough board can be a pain (but that's also part of the fun)\r\n- Doesn't look flashy, but that's up to the creator to customize away\r\n\r\nPros\r\n- Easily adjustable height. There were some complaints I heard from people about the manual hand crank taking too long and to that I just shake my head. If you can't turn a crank 10-20 times to stand up you probably also think riding a bike down your driveway is a chore.\r\n- Durable. I also read complaints about durability. I've moved twice since building this and it's still solid.\r\n- Price. Under 200 for the frame and you should be able to find a board for around $50 or less\r\n- Customizable. Unlike cheap Ikea furniture, if you use real wood you don't have to worry about screwing in PC mounts, shelving, or whatever weird customizations you may want to make.\r\n\r\n[Also if you need some cable management, VIVO makes this sleeve that worked perfectly for me.](https://amzn.to/2P8z4LU)\r\n\r\ntldr; I recommend this desk for anyone really as long as you have the need for a desk at least 40 inches wide.",
