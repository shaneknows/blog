Hey! I'm moving the blog to use Next.js. It builds out a static site and allows me to build a nice little react app so demos should be easier to set up. I also put in support for markdown so I can continue doing the blog deal thanks to [tscanlin](https://github.com/tscanlin/next-blog). Who knows, maybe I will get around to posting more than once a year.
